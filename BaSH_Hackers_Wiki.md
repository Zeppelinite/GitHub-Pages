This wiki is intended to hold documentation of any kind about GNU Bash. The main motivation was to provide _human-readable documentation_ and information so users aren't forced to read every bit of the Bash manpage - which can be difficult to understand. However, the docs here are **not** meant as a newbie tutorial.
