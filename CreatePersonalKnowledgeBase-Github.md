Creating a Personal Knowledge Base on Github

Github isn‚Äôt just for coders ‚Äî as the amount of information around us grows exponentially, everybody can be helped by a personal knowledge base.

Step 1: Get a Github account.
=============================

Github is free provided that you don‚Äôt want to create private repositories (the last time I checked).

Visit: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Step 2: Create a new repository matching your username
======================================================

Once you‚Äôve signed up, navigate to the top right-hand corner and click _New repository_:

On the next screen, enter a repository name that matches the Github username you signed up with.

For example, my Github username is _georgemarklow_, so I‚Äôd create a repository called _georgemarklow_.

Below that, make sure the repository is _Public_ check the box _Add a README_ file.

The _Choose a license_ section is optional.

Step 3: Update the README file
==============================

The README.md file provides some direction for the user who visits your knowledge base and is nicely displayed on your Github homepage.

To edit the README file, click on the _Repositories_ menu tab and find your just created repository.

Click on the _README.md_ file (you won't have other files shown below).

Click on the pencil icon to edit this file:

GitHub now takes you to a markdown editor, which allows you to format your opening statement.

If you‚Äôre new to the markdown language, let me help you by sharing this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), which covers everything you need to know.

You can also copy my README markdown by visiting this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgemarklow/georgemarklow/main/README.md) to get you started with a template‚Äî remember to change the links to your own!

Once you‚Äôve done that, preview your changes by clicking on the _Preview_ tab.

STEP 4 (optional): Add a SUMMARY.md file
========================================

I prefer to keep my _README.md_ file as a short opening statement and provide more detail in the _SUMMARY.md_ file.

It‚Äôs also where I like to tell people about my values.

To create a new file, click the _Add file_ button and select _Create new file_ (or clone this repository locally, if you prefer).

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*yNIJCDcmRIV5gy6Q3Ftf6Q.png)

Then type the name of the file, ending with _.md_:
